;; Design a function that consumes a natural number >= 2 and
;; produces a "chess board" of that size. 
;;
;; For coloring:
;;  - assume the upper left corner is row,column 0,0
;;  - follow the rule that if the sum of the row and column number is odd,
;;    the square should be black, otherwise it should be white
;;
;; Do not worry about placing a border around your board.
;;
;; For example (board 4) should produce something like this:
;;
;; https://s3.amazonaws.com/edx-course-spdx-kiczales/HTC/problems/16w1fboard.PNG
;;
;; HINT: If you are stuck, first sketch out a function that produces
;; a single row of squares all the same colour.

;; As you know, the template for using a for-each loop is:

;;
;; Of course given any template you can produce an abstract function definition 
;; by simply replacing each set of dots with a parameter. We have done that for
;; you below and named the function foldfe for fold with for-each.
;;
;; Please complete this abstract function by adding its signature and the
;; following 3 check expects:
;;
;;   - one that uses foldfe to sum (list 2 3 4) to get 9
;;   - one that uses foldfe to multiply (list 2 3 4) to get 24
;;   - one that uses foldfe to average (list 2 3 4) to get 3
;;
;; Each individual check-expect must only call for-each one time.  If you can't
;; fit your check-expects here there is plenty of room on the next page.

(@problem 5)
;; Below is a function that consumes the representation of a simple map, and
;; produces the total combined number of ponds and islands on that map.
;; 
;; In this exam problem you need to modify the function design so that instead
;; of producing a single number which is the sum of the number of ponds and
;; the number of islands, it instead produces a (listof (listof Pos)). The
;; (listof (listof Pos)) has one (listof Pos) for each pond or island. The
;; positions in the list are all the positions in that pond or island.
;; 
;; For example, calling your revised function as follows:
;;
;; (count-pi (list W W W
;;                 W L W
;;                 W W W))
;;
;; Should produce:
;;
;; (list (list (make-posn 1 1))
;;      
;;       (list (make-posn 0 0) (make-posn 0 1) (make-posn 0 2)
;;             (make-posn 1 2) (make-posn 2 2)
;;             (make-posn 2 1) (make-posn 2 0) (make-posn 1 0)))
;;
;; Do not worry about the order of elements in the lists! If your function
;; produces lists with the same positions as your check-expects we will consider
;; it correct.
;;
;; Be sure to follow all recipe elements correctly.
;;
;;
;; NOTE: Spend some time carefully reading the existing design before you start.
;; The changes you need to make, especially to the function definition, are
;; relatively minor. You can make the changes by making edits on the existing
;; design. So writing the changes shouldn't take very long. Working out exactly
;; what the changes should be is likely to take longer.
